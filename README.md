# OSSubprocess

OSSubprocess allows users to spawn Operating System processes from within Pharo language. The main usage of forking external OS processes is to execute OS commands (.e.g `cat`, `ls`, `ps`, `cp`, etc) as well as arbitrary shell scripts (.e.g `/etc/myShellScript.sh`) from Pharo. Up until now OSSubprocess works on Mac and Linux.

An important part of OSSubprocess is how to manage standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`) and how to provide an API for reading and writing from them at the language level.

> It was decided together with Pharo Consortium that as a first step, we should concentrate on making it work on OSX and Unix. If the tool proves to be good and accepted, we could, at a second step, try to add Windows support.

## Installation
OSSubprocess only works in Pharo >= 5.0 with Spur VM.

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
 	baseline: 'OSSubprocess';
 	repository: 'github://pharo-contributions/OSSubprocess:master/repository';
	load.
```

> Important: Do not load OSProcess project in the same image of OSSubprocess because the latter won't work.

> Important2: If you are installing under Linux, then you must use a threaded heartbeat VM (not the itimer one). For Pharo 5.0 and 6.0 you can search for "cog_linux32x86_pharo.cog.spur_XXXXXXXXXXXX.tar.gz" i32 [Pharo static file server](http://files.pharo.org/vm/pharo-spur32/linux/). Since Pharo 7.0, threaded heartbeat VM has become the default installation, so you shouldn't have to explicitly download a specific VM.

## Getting Started
OSSubprocess is quite easy to use but depending on the user needs, there are different parts of the API that could be used. We start with a basic example and later we show more complicated scenarios.

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/ls';
	arguments: #('-la' '/Users');
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :process :outString  |
		outString inspect
	]
```

Until we add support for Windows, the entry point will always be OSSUnixSubprocess, which should work in OSX, Linux and others Unix-like. You can read it's class comments for details.

A subprocess consist of at least a command/binary/program to be executed (in this example `/bin/ls`) plus some optional array of arguments.

The `#command:` could be either the program name (.e.g `ls`) or the full path to the executable (.e.g `/bin/ls`). If the former, then the binary will be searched using `$PATH` variable and may not be found.  

For the `#arguments:` array, each argument must be a different element. In other words, passing `#('-la /Users')` is not correct since those are 2 arguments and hence should be 2 elements of the array. It is also incorrect to not specify `#arguments:` and specify the command like this: `command: '/bin/ls -la /Users'`. OSSubprocess does *not* do any parsing of the command or arguments. If you want to execute a command with a full string like `/bin/ls -la /Users`, you may want to take a look to `#bashCommand:` which relies on shell to do that job.

With `#redirectStdout` we are saying that we want to create a stream and that we want to map it to `stdout` of the child process. Since they are not specified, `stderr` and `stdin` will then be inherit from the parent process (Pharo VM process). If you comment out the line of `#redirectStdout` and run the example again, you can see how the output of `/bin/ls -la /Users` is printed in the terminal (where you launched your Pharo image).

Finally, we use the `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` which is a high level API method that runs the process, waits for it until it finishes, reads and then closes the `stdout` stream, and finally invokes the passed closure. In the closure we get as arguments the original `OSSUnixSubprocess` instance we created, and the contents of the read `stdout`. If you inspect `outString` you should see the output of `/bin/ls -la /Users` which should be exactly the same as if run from the command line.

## API Reference

### Child exit status
When you spawn a process in Unix, the new process becomes a "child" of the "parent" process that launched it. In our case, the parent process is the Pharo VM process and the child process would be the one executing the command (in above example, `/bin/ls`). It is a responsibility of the parent process to collect the exit status of the child once it finishes. If the parent does not do this, the child becomes a "zombie" process. The exit status is an integer that represents how the child finished (if successful, if error, which error, if received a signal, etc etc.). Besides avoiding zombies, the exit status is also important for the user to take actions depending on its result.

#### OSSVMProcess and it's child watcher

In OSSubprocess, we have a class `OSSVMProcess` with a singleton instance accessed via a class side method `vmProcess` which represents the operating system process in which the Pharo VM is currently running. OSSVMProcess can answer some information about the OS process running the VM, such as running PID, children, etc etc. More can be added later.

Another important task of this class is to keep track of all the launched child processes (instances of `OSSUnixSubprocess`). Whenever a process is started it's registered in OSSVMProcess and unregister in certain scenarios (see senders of ``#unregisterChildProcess:``). We keep a  list of all our children, and occasionally prune all those that have already exited.

This class takes care of running what we call the "child watcher" which is basically a way to monitor children's status and collect exit code when they finish. This also guarantees not to create zombies processes. As for the implementation details, we use a SIGCHLD handler to capture a child death. For more details, see method `#initializeChildWatcher`.

*What is important here is that whether you wait for the process to finish or not (and no matter in which way you wait), the child exit code will be collected and stored in the `exitStatus` instVar of the instance of `OSSUnixSubprocess` representing the exited process, thanks to the `OSSVMProcess` child watcher.*

#### Accessing child status and interpreting it
No matter how you waited for the child process to finish, when it exited, the instVar `exitStatus` should have been set. `exitStatus` is an integer bit field answered by the `wait()` system call that contains information about the exit status of the process. The meaning of the bit field varies according to the cause of the process exit. Besides understanding `#exitStatus`, `OSSUnixSubprocess` also understands `#exitStatusInterpreter` which answers an instance of `OSSUnixProcessExitStatus`. The task of this class is to simply decode this integer bit field and provide meaningful information. Please read its class comment for further details.

In addition to `#exitStatus` and `#exitStatusInterpreter`, `OSSUnixSubprocess` provides testing methods such us `#isSuccess`, `#isComplete`, `isRunning`, etc.

Let's see a possible usage of the exit status:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/ls';
	arguments: #('-la' '/nonexistent');
	redirectStdout;
	redirectStderr;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :process :outString :errString |
		process isSuccess
			ifTrue: [ Transcript show: 'Command exited correctly with output: ', outString. ]
			ifFalse: [
				"OSSUnixProcessExitStatus has a nice #printOn: "
				Transcript show: 'Command exit with error status: ', process exitStatusInterpreter printString; cr.
				Transcript show: 'Stderr contents: ', errString.
			]
	]
```

In this example we execute `/bin/ls` passing a none existing directory as argument.

First, note that we add also a stream for `stderr` via `#redirectStderr`. Second, note how now in the `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` we can also have access to `errString`. If you run this example with a `Transcript` opened, you should see something like:

```
Command exit with error status: normal termination with status 1
Stderr contents: ls: /nonexistent: No such file or directory
```

The `normal termination with status 1` is the information that `OSSUnixProcessExitStatus` (accessed via `#exitStatusInterpreter`) decoded for us. "Normal termination" means it was not signaled or terminated, but rather a normal exit. The exit status bigger than zero (in this case, 1), means error. What each error means depends on the program you run.

The second line of the `Transcript` is simply the `stderr` contents.  


### Streams management
There are many parts of the API and features of OSSubprocess which are related to streams. In this section we will try to explain these topics.

#### Handling pipes within Pharo
Besides regular files (as the files you are used to deal with), Unix provides **pipes**. Since Unix manages pipes  polymorphically to regular files, you can use both for mapping standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`). That means that both kind of files can be used to communicate a parent and a child process.

For regular files, Pharo already provides `Stream` classes to write and read from them, such as `StandardFileStream` and subclasses. For pipes things are different because there is a write end and a read end (each having a different file descriptor at Unix level). For this purpose, we have implemented the class called `OSSPipe` which represents a OS pipe and it is a subclass of `Stream`. `OSSPipe` contains both, a `reader` and a `writer`, and it implements the `Stream` protocol by delegating messages to one or the other. For example `OSSPipe>>#nextPutAll:` is delegated to the writer while `#next` is delegated to the reader. That way, we have a Stream-like API for pipes. For more details, please read the class comment of `OSSPipe`.

The question is now what type of streams are the 'reader' and 'writer' instVars of a `OSSPipe`. As I said before, the write end and read end of a pipe have different file descriptor at Unix level, hence they are seem as two different file streams. When we create a pipe via a system call, we directly get both file descriptors. That means that in Pharo, once we created a OS pipe, we already have both, the read and the write. Ideally, we could use `StandardFileStream` for this case too. However, those file streams were *already opened* by the system call to make the pipes. To solve this issue, we created what we call `OSSAttachableFileStream` which is a special subclass of `StandardFileStream` and that can be *attached* to an already existing and opened file.

To conclude, we use a system call to create an OS pipe. At Pharo level we represent that pipe as an instance of `OSSPipe`. And a `OSSPipe` has both, a reader and a writer which are both instances of `OSSAttachableFileStream` and that have been attached to the reader and writer end of the pipe.

#### Regular files vs pipes
As we said before, both regular files or pipes can be used for mapping standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`) and OSSubprocess supports both and manages them polymorphically thanks to `OSSPipe` and `OSSAttachableFileStream`.

> **Important:** For regular files, you **must** use instances of `StandardFileStream` since we have some problems when using instances of `MultiByteFileStream`. So... try not to use the `FileSystem` library for creating file streams but rather `StandardFileStream` directly.

The user can decide to use one or another. Pipes are normally faster since they run in memory. On the contrary, files may do I/0 operations even with caches (at least creating and deleting the file). With pipes you do not have to handle the deletion of the files as you do with regular files. You can read more about "regular files vs pipes" in the internet and come yourself to a conclusion.

> **Important** We have found some problems when using regular files for the `stdin`. While we do not strictly forbid that, we recommend you do so only if you know very well what you are doing. Otherwise, use blocking pipes for `stdin` (default behavior).

> **Important** Our recommendation as a rule of thumb is to always use pipes rather than regular files. That is, none-blocking pipes for `stdout` and `stderr` and blocking pipes for `stdin`.

There is only one problem with pipes that you should be aware of and it's the fact that you may get a deadlock in certain situations. See [Semaphore-based SIGCHLD waiting](#semaphore-based-sigchld-waiting) for more details.

#### Customizing streams creation
Let's consider this example:

```Smalltalk
| process |
process := OSSUnixSubprocess new
			command: '/bin/ls';
			arguments: #('-la' '/nonexistent');
			defaultWriteStreamCreationBlock: [OSSVMProcess vmProcess systemAccessor makeNonBlockingPipe];
			redirectStdout;
			redirectStderrTo: (StandardFileStream forceNewFileNamed: '/tmp/customStderr.txt');
			defaultReadStreamCreationBlock: [ OSSUnixSubprocess createTempFileToBeUsedAsReadStreamOn: '/tmp' ];
			createMissingStandardStreams: true.
Halt halt.			
process runAndWait.  
process isSuccess
	ifTrue: [ Transcript show: 'Command exited correctly with output: ', process stdoutStream upToEndOfFile. ]
	ifFalse: [
		"OSSUnixProcessExitStatus has a nice #printOn: "
		Transcript show: 'Command exit with error status: ', process exitStatusInterpreter printString; cr.
		Transcript show: 'Stderr contents: ', process stderrStream upToEndOfFile.
	].
process closeAndCleanStreams.
```

There are many things to explain in this example. First of all, we are not using the API `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` and so certain things must be done manually (like retrieving the contents of the streams via `#upToEndOfFile` and closing and cleaning streams with `#closeAndCleanStreams`). Now you get a better idea of what `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` does automatically for you. The reason we are not using `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` and instead the low level API, is to have a `Halt halt` while running the process so that you can confirm yourself the existence of the files used for the streams, as explained next.

With the methods `#redirectStdinTo:`, `#redirectStdoutTo:` and `#redirectStdoutTo:` the user is able to set a custom stream for each standard stream. The received stream could be either a `StandardFileStream` (as is the result of `StandardFileStream forceNewFileNamed: '/tmp/customStderr.txt'`) or a `OSSPipe` (as is the result of `OSSVMProcess vmProcess systemAccessor makeNonBlockingPipe`).

If you do not want to create a custom stream (like above example of `#redirectStderrTo:`) but you still want to create a default stream that would be mapped to a standard stream, then you can use the methods `#redirectStdin:`, `#redirectStdout` and `#redirectStderr`. Those methods will create *default* streams. The *default* streams are defined by the instVars `defaultWriteStreamCreationBlock` and `defaultReadStreamCreationBlock`. And these can be customized too as shown in above example. In this example, all write streams (to be used for `stdout` and `stderr`) will be pipes (forget for the moment about the none blocking part). And all read streams (only used by `stdin`) will be temp files automatically created in `/tmp`. This feature is useful if you want to change the way streams are created without having to specially create each stream. You can see how `OSSPipeBasedUnixSubprocessTest` and `OSSFileBasedUnixSubprocessTest` use these in the method `#newCommand`.

*If you see `OSSUnixSubprocess>>#initialize` you will see that by default we create pipes for all type of streams.*

Previously, we said that if the user does not specify a stream to be mapped to one of the standard streams (by any of the means explained above), the child will inherit the one of the parent process (VM Process). With the method `#createMissingStandardStreams:` one can change that behavior, and instead, create default streams for all none already defined streams. In above example, the user defined `stdout` via `#redirectStdout` and `stderr` via `#redirectStderrTo:`. So, by doing `#createMissingStandardStreams: true`, a default stream (pipe) will be created and mapped to the missing streams (only `stdin` in this example). Of course, if you are happy with default streams creation, you can avoid having to declare each stream and simple enable all. But keep in mind the costs of managing streams that you may not use at all. For this reason, the default value of `createMissingStandardStreams` is `false`.

Finally, note that since we are not using the API `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:` in this case, we must explicitly close streams via the message `#closeAndCleanStreams`. This method will also take care of deleting all those streams which were regular files (not pipes).


#### Stdin example
All of the examples so far showed how to redirect `stdout` and `stderr`. Below is an example on how can we redirect `stdin` and write to it from Pharo:

```Smalltalk
| process |
process := OSSUnixSubprocess new
				command: '/bin/cat';
				redirectStdin;
				redirectStdout;
				run.
process stdinStream
		nextPutAll: 'we are testing!';
		nextPutAll: 'we again!';
		close.		
process waitForExit.
process stdoutStream upToEndOfFile inspect.
process closeAndCleanStreams.
```

If you run above example you will see how the strings are first written to the `stdin` of the child process and then the child writes them to `stdout` (that's what the `cat` command does). We finally read them from `stdout`.  

Note that the `#close` we send to the `stdinStream` is very important. This is because by default, we use blocking pipes for `stdin` and that means that when the child tries to read he will be locked until data is available. Therefore, somehow, at some point, we must tell the child that we have finished writing and that is via the `#close` message.

### Synchronism and  how to read streams

####  Synchronism vs asynchronous runs
We call synchronous runs when you create a child process and you wait for it to finish before going to the next task of your code. This is by far the most common approach since many times you need to know which was the exit status (wether it was success or not) or get some output, and depending on that, change the flow of your code.

Asynchronous runs are when you run a process and you do not care it's results for the next task of your code. In other words, your code can continue its execution no matter what happened with the spawned process.

Let's see this example:

```Smalltalk
| process |
process := OSSUnixSubprocess new
				command: '/bin/ls';
				run. 	
process waitForExit.
process isSuccess
	ifTrue: [ self doSomethingWithSucess ]
	ifFalse: [ self doSomethingWithFailure ].
process closeAndCleanStreams.
self myNextCodeAction.
```

`myNextCodeAction` represents the user code (user of this library) that will run after spawning the process. The important question here is when should the line `self myNextCodeAction` be executed? Does `myNextCodeAction` depend on the exit status of the forked process or it needs some of its output?

If `myNextCodeAction` should be executed after the forked process has finished, then it is synchronous. Otherwise, asynchronous.

**The way the previous and next examples are written are actually synchronous. In [Asynchronous runs](#asynchronous-runs) we see how can we make asynchronous calls.**

#### When to process streams
If we have defined that we wanted to map a standard stream, it means that at some point we would like to read/write it and **do something with it**.
There are basically two possibilities here. The most common approach is to simply wait until the process has finished, and once finished, depending on the exit status, **do something** with the stream contents. What to do exactly, depends on the needs the user has for that process.

The other possibility a user may do, is to define some code that loops while the process is still running. For every cycle of the loop, it retrieves what is available from the streams and do something with it. But in this case, **doing something** is not simply accumulating the stream contents in another stream so that it is processed at the end. By doing something we really mean that the user wants to do something with that intermediate result: print it in a `Transcript`, show a progress bar, or whatever.  


#### Streams processing at the end
For the scenario in which streams processing should be done once a process has exited, we provide some facilities methods that should ease the usage. Processing the streams at the end also means that somehow we should wait for the process to finish. We provide two ways of doing this.

##### Semaphore-based SIGCHLD waiting
The first way is with the method `#waitForExit`. This method is used by the high level API methods `#runAndWait` and `#runAndWaitOnExitDo:`. The wait in this scenario does **not** use an image-based delay polling. Instead, it uses a semaphore. Just after the process starts, it waits on a semaphore of the instVar `mutexForSigchld`. When the `OSSVMProcess` child watcher receives a `SIGCHLD` signal, it will notify the child that die with the message `#processHasExitNotification`. That method, will do the `#signal` in the semaphore and hence the execution of `#waitForExit` will continue.

> **IMPORTANT** In this kind of waiting there is no polling and hence we do not read from the streams periodically. Instead, we read the whole contents of each stream at the end. Basically, there is a problem in general (deadlock!) with waiting for an external process to exit before reading its output. If the external process creates a large amount of output, and if the output is a pipe, it will block on writing to the pipe until someone (our VM process) reads some data from the pipe to make room for the writing. That leads to cases where we never read the output (because the external process did not exit) and the external process never exits (because we have not read the data from the pipe to make room for the writing).

> Another point to take into account is that this kind of wait also depends on the child watcher and `SIGCHLD` capture. While we do our best to make this as reliable as possible, it might be cases where we miss some `SIGCHLD` signals. There is a workaround for that (see method `#initializeChildWatcher`), but there may still be issues. If such problem happens, the child process (at our language level) never exits from the `#waitForExit` method. And at the OS level, the child would look like a zombie because the parent did not collect the exit status.

##### Delay-based polling waiting
The other way we have for waiting a child process is by doing a delay-based in-image polling. That basically means a loop in which we wait some milliseconds, and then check the exit status of the process. For this, we provide the method `#waitForExitPollingEvery:retrievingStreams:`, and it's high level API method `#runAndWaitPollingEvery:retrievingStreams:onExitDo:`.

It is important to note that as part of the loop we send `#queryExitStatus`, which is the one that sends the `waitpid()` in Unix. That means that we are fully independent of the child watcher and the `SIGCHLD` and hence much more reliable than the previous approach.

In addition, we provide a `retrievingStreams:` boolean which if true, it reads from streams as part of the loop. This solves the problem mentioned before where there could be a deadlock if there is no room in the pipe for the writing.

Below is an example of delay polling:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/ls';
	arguments: #('-la' '/Users');
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitPollingEvery: (Delay forMilliseconds: 50) retrievingStreams: true onExitDo: [
		:process :outString  |
		outString inspect
	]
```


Of course, the main disadvantage of the polling is the cost of it at the language level. The waiting on a semaphore (as with the `SIGCHLD`) has no cost.  

##### Which waiting to use?
If you are using pipes (which is our recommendation) and you are not sure about how much the child process could write in the streams, then we recommend the polling approach (with `retrievingStreams:` with `true`).

If you are using pipes and you know the process will not write much, then you can use both approaches. If you want to be sure 100% to never ever get a zombie or related problem, then we think the polling approach is a bit more reliable. If you can live with such a possibility, then maybe the `SIGCHLD` approach could work too.

If you are using files instead of pipes, then it would depend on how long does the process take. If it is normally short, then the polling approach would be fine. If it is a long process then you may want to do the `SIGCHLD` approach to avoid the polling costs. But you can also use the polling approach and specify a larger timeout.

*As you can see, there is no silver bullet. It's up to the user to know which model would fit better for his use-case. If you are uncertain or you are not an expert, then go with the polling approach with `retrievingStreams:` on `true`.*

#### Processing streams while running
Instead of processing the streams once the process has finished, the other alternative is to process the streams while the process runs.

To demonstrate the facilities we provide for this case, we will see an example in which we invoke the command `tail -f /var/log/system.log`. In this example we use `/var/log/system.log` because it's a file whose contents grows frequently on OSX, but the example could apply to any file. What the example does is to poll with a delay and in every cycle of the loop, read from `stdout` and append that into a `Pharo Playground`:

```Smalltalk
| streamsInfo totalStdout page playground |
totalStdout := String new writeStream.
"These first lines just open a Pharo Playground with an initial content"
(page := GTPlayPage new)
	saveContent: 'initial content'.
(playground := GTPlayground new)
	openOn: page.
[
	OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: 'tail';
	arguments: #('-f' '/var/log/system.log' );
	redirectStdout;
	redirectStderr;
	runAndWaitPollingEvery: (Delay forMilliseconds: 500)
	doing: [ :process :outStream :errStream |  
		| read |
		read := outStream upToEnd.
		"Next 2 lines is to simply update the Playground"
		page saveContent: (page content, read).
		playground update.
		totalStdout nextPutAll: read.
		errStream upToEnd.
	]
	onExitDo: [ :process :outStream :errStream  |
		process closeAndCleanStreams.
		Transcript show: 'Total stdout: ', totalStdout contents.
	]
] fork.
```

If you run above code, you will see how a Pharo Playground is opened and every half second the contents are refreshed and appended at the end. The most important method here is `runAndWaitPollingEvery:doing:onExitDo:` which is the facility we provide for these scenarios. However, there are other points to mention:

* The user must explicitly close streams. It could be inside the `onExitDo:` or elsewhere, but must be done. We cannot automatically close streams because we don't know if the user has retrieved their contents or not (we cannot know what the user will do in the `doing:` closure).
* If using pipes, the user must be sure to either retrieve steam contents as part of the `doing:` block or else make sure the process will not be writing much on them. Otherwise, you may hit the deadlock mentioned in [Semaphore-based SIGCHLD waiting](#semaphore-based-sigchld-waiting).
* Contrary to regular files, the read of a pipe **consumes** the read. That is, you cannot read more than once a particular content. So for example, say you read from `stdout` in the `doing:` closure and then in `onExitDo:` you would like to do something with the total of the `stdout` (in this example, print it in the `Transcript`). If you read from `stdout` in `onExitDo:`, in this example, you will get nothing, because it was already read and consumed. To avoid loosing what you read (in case you need it later), you must store it somewhere yourself (in this example in the temp variable `totalStdout`).
* So far in this guide we have always used `upToEndOfFile` to retrieve streams contents. Sending such message is ideal once the process has exited. But if it is running and still writing into the standard streams, then the message to send is `upToEnd` which simply reads all available data in the stream. And that does not necessary mean the end of the file or the pipe (the child process may have written even more on it).
* For this type of "Processing streams while running" we strongly recommend pipes over regular files.
* If we run above code without the `fork` it will work but the Pharo UI will not be refreshed and it won't display the new Playground until the process has stopped. This could be considered as an example of asynchronous calls as explained in [Asynchronous runs](#asynchronous-runs).


####  Asynchronous runs
The previous example of the `tail -f` was an asynchronous run. Why? Because we wanted the user code to continue running (in this case the Pharo UI showing us the Playground with the `tail` contents) regardless of what happened with the spawned process. In general, the way to launch asynchronous processes is like this:

```Smalltalk
[
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: 'whatever';
	arguments: #();
	...
] fork.
self continueWithOtherCode.
```

### Sending signals to processes
OSSubprocess provides a way of sending UNIX signals (`SIGKILL`, `SIGTERM`, etc.) to the spawned process. There are many scenarios in which this is useful, such us terminating or killing an existing process for whatever reason you have. Some OS commands, like `tail -f`, do not even finish unless you explicitly tell it to do so. If we consider again the `tail -f` example you may now realize that that process will run forever.

Which signals to send and when it completely up to the user. Under the protocol `OS signal sending`, the class `OSSUnixSubprocess` provides one method per signal. Examples: `#sigterm`, `#sigkill`, `#sigint`, `#sighup`, etc. Each of those methods will simply send the signal in question to the external process.

See this example:

```Smalltalk
| counter |
counter := 0.
[  
	OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: 'tail';
	arguments: #('-f' '/var/log/system.log' );
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitPollingEvery: (Delay forMilliseconds: 500)
	doing: [ :process :outStream  |  
		counter := counter + 1.
		Transcript show: outStream upToEnd; cr.
		counter > 10 ifTrue: [ process sigterm ]
	]
	onExitDo: [ :process :outStream :errStream  |
		process closeAndCleanStreams.
		Transcript show: 'Process has exited with status: ', process exitStatusInterpreter printString; cr.
	]
] fork.
```

If you open a `Transcript` and execute above example, you will see how the changes to `/var/log/system.log` are displayed there for approx. 5 seconds and then it stops. It should have also printed `Process has exited with status: exit due to signal 15`, demonstrating that the exit is managed correctly. In addition, it shows up how the `exitStatusInterpreter` correctly interprets that the exit of the process was due to signal 15, which is `SIGTERM`.


**Again, when and which signals to send depends on the user.**


### System shutdown
What would happen if you are running an asynchronous process (with `#fork`) and Pharo quits? Pharo can quit because of a crash, because the user accidentally quits it, or any other reason.

By default, when Pharo is quitting, the `OSSVMProcess vmProcess` tells all active children to `#stopWaiting`. The `#stopWaiting` basically makes children to stop waiting for the external process and just finish. This allows the external process to finish (at the OS level), even if Pharo has quitted. In this scenario, its likely the child to become an *orphan* process since it's parent has die (Pharo VM). Orphan processes do what is called  `re-parenting` which basically means they become children of the `init` process.

Contrary to the default behavior, we also provide the method `OSSUnixSubprocess >> terminateOnShutdown` which tells the system to automatically **terminate** (via `sigterm`) the external process when Pharo is quitting. We also collect the exit status in this case.

It depends on the user which behavior he wants.

### Environment variables

#### Setting environment variables

One common requirement for child processes is to define environment variables for them, that may not even exist in the parent process. Let's see an example:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/usr/bin/git';
	arguments: #('-C' '/Users/mariano/git/OSSubprocess' 'commit');
	environmentAt: 'GIT_EDITOR' put: '/Users/mariano/bin/mate';
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :process :outString  |]
```

In this example we are executing `/usr/bin/git` and we are telling it to commit from the directory `/Users/mariano/git/OSSubprocess`. Without any particular environment variable setting, `git` will use the default editor. In my machine, it will use `nano` editor. However, in above example, we are setting a environment variable called `GIT_EDITOR` (which is *not* set in parent process) with the value `/Users/mariano/bin/mate` (TextMate editor for OSX). When we run this example, `git` will then use TextMate for entering the commit message instead of `nano`.

#### Variables are not expanded
You should not confuse the above example with variables expansions. Consider now this example:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/echo';
	arguments: #('${HOME}');
	environmentAt: 'HOME' put: 'hello';
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :command :outString |
		outString inspect
	].
```

What do you expect to be the `outString`? Well, the answer is the literal string `${HOME}`. This is because OSSubprocess does *not* expands variables. It does *set* variables, but that's not the same as expanding them.

Variable expansion is a responsibility of the shell, not of the command. Specific commands will of course consult their environment, but only for variables that they are designed to use (e.g. `git` will use $GIT_EDITOR or fall back to $EDITOR when you have to type a commit message).

To conclude this topic, see this example:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/sh';
	arguments: #('-c' 'echo ${HOME}');
	environmentAt: 'HOME' put: 'hello';
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :command :outString |
		outString inspect. 	
	].
```

In this case, the `outString` is indeed `hello` and this is simply because `/bin/sh` did the variable expansion before executing the `echo`.


#### Accessing environment variables
It seems some people use OSProcess (or maybe even OSSubprocess) to access environment variables. **This is not needed and it's not the best approach**. Pharo provides an out of the box way for accessing environment variables. For example, `Smalltalk platform environment at: 'PWD'` answers `/Users/mariano/Pharo/imagenes`. So, use that API for retrieving environment variables.

Finally, not that you can "expand" yourself the value of a variable prior to spawning a process and hence avoid the need of the shell. example:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/bin/echo';
	arguments: (Array with: (Smalltalk platform environment at: 'HOME'));
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :command :outString |
		outString inspect
	].
```

In this example, `outString` will be `/Users/mariano`.  


#### Inherit variables from parent
If you don't define any variable via `#environmentAt:put:`, then by default, we will make the child process inherit all the variables from the parent process. If you did define at least one variable, then by default the child inherits no variable. However, you have the method `#addAllEnvVariablesFromParentWithoutOverride` which basically adds all the variables inherit from the parent but those that you have explicitly set (if any).



### Shell commands
Sometimes, the process you want to execute is a shell. There are a couple of reasons for doing so:

* Variables expansion.
* Pipelines.
* When there is already logic in `.bash_profile`, `.profile` or such kind of file.
* Command path resolution.
* Streams redirection.
* Available shell scripts that you want to execute.
* Convenience when you don't need to have full control.

Quite some of that list can easily be done without the need of a shell, as already explained. But some of them, still need the shell. To avoid having to invoke a shell as seen in [Variables are not expanded](#variables-are-not-expanded), we provide the methods `#shellCommand:` and `#shell:command:`. Example:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	shellCommand: 'ps -fea | grep Pharo > /tmp/testShellCommandWithStreamRedirects.deleteme';
	redirectStdout;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :command :outString |
		outString inspect. 					
	].
```

Of course, `outString` is empty now because the shell has redirected it to a particular file.

`shellCommand:` will first try to use the shell defined in the OS by getting the env variable `$SHELL`. If not defined, then it will fallback to `/bin/sh`. `#shell:command:` is similar to `#shellCommand:` but allows the user to specify the full path of the shell to use (for example `/bin/zsh`).

> Note that when using the shell you must type the command exactly as the shell expects it, that is, with all the escaping and everything needed.


### Setting working directory
Another common need when spawning processes is to set a working directory (`PWD`) for them. If none is set, by default, they inherit the working directory of the parent. Imagine the Pharo image was launched from a terminal while `PWD` was `/Users/mariano`. Now imagine I want to spawn a process for a git commit for the directory `/Users/mariano/git/OSSubprocess`. For this to work, I must specify the working directory for the child. Otherwise, the `commit` will be triggered in `/Users/mariano`.

To support this, we provide the method `#workingDirectory:` as this example shows:

```Smalltalk
OSSUnixSubprocess new
	command: '/usr/bin/git';
	arguments: #('commit' '-m' 'testing');
	workingDirectory: '/Users/mariano/git/OSSubprocess';
	redirectStdout;
	redirectStderr;
	runAndWaitOnExitDo: [ :process :outString :errString |
		errString inspect.
		outString inspect.
		]
```

> The implementation of `#workingDirectory::` is quite rudimentary and bad from performance point of view (read the method comment for details). If the program you are executing allows you to specify the path, then we recommend you to do so. For example, in this case, `git` allow us to specify the path with the argument `-C`. That approach would be better, as shown in [Setting environment variables](#setting-environment-variables).

## Future work
Besides the [issues](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/OSSubprocess/issues), the following are also desired features:

* Instead of using asynchronous I/O operations with FFI blocking callouts, sse synchronous I/O operations but with threaded FFI callouts. This will only be possible once Pharo VM and FFI supports threaded callouts.
* Experiment with a VM plugin with a single `forkAndExec` kind of primitive (based on OSProcess one) and avoid using `posix_spawn()` family of functions.
* Experiment with a Windows support by calling via FFI to `CreateProcess()`. Note there is a VM plugin called [ProcessorWrapper](http://leves.web.elte.hu/ProcessWrapper/) that wraps such a function. So we can base our work from it.
* Implement a pipeline at Pharo level. That is, to be able to create multiple instances of `OSSUnixSubprocess` which we will be piped each other. We can base our work in OSProcess `ProxyPipeline`.

## Acknowledgments and Funding

* OSSubprocess is highly influenced by a subset of the [OSProcess](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/708) project. There are parts which we even copied and adapted them (OSSPipe, OSSAttachableStream, OSSUnixProcessExitStatus). Other parts, we took them as inspiration (the idea of ThisOSProcess representing the VM process, the child watcher, and many others). In addition, OSSubprocess currently uses some of the OSProcess **plugin** (not OSProcess image side), such as the SIGCHLD handler or the creation of pipes.
* Took some ideas from [Limbo](https://github.com/theseion/liblimbo)
